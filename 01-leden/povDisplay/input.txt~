As with procedural writing in general, the textuality of this electronic art may 'thin out' the complexities of reception or undercut the (constitutive) emphasis on active readership - on reading as much more than the sensation of being caught up in (or cannibalized by) an algorithm. Can we banish the author as a dictatorial pseudo-presence, without reducing the mode of reception to a minimalist-behaviorist schematics?
